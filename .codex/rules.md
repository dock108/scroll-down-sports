# Codex Task Rules — Scroll Down Sports

## Goal
Tasks should be runnable without guessing.

## Format

### Task
One clear sentence describing what to build or fix.

### Context
Why this matters, especially for spoilers, performance, or UI clarity.

### Requirements
- bullet list of concrete outcomes
- avoid vague language
- describe UX expectations when relevant

### Done When
- checklist users/devs can verify quickly

### Notes (optional)
- assumptions
- impacted files/components
- docs/tests to touch if needed

## Guidance
- Prefer iterative tasks, not giant rewrites.
- Assume intelligent defaults.
- Always think: “Does this help someone follow a game better?”

Clear > clever.
