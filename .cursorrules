# AI Coding Rules

## Universal Standards

### Code Quality
- Write clear, self-documenting code. Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Small, focused functions. One responsibility per function.
- No magic numbers or hardcoded strings—use constants.
- Fail fast. Validate inputs early, handle errors explicitly.
- No silent failures. Log or surface all errors.

### Change Philosophy
- Prefer minimal, incremental changes over rewrites.
- Don't refactor unrelated code while fixing bugs.
- If something works, don't "improve" it without reason.
- Leave code cleaner than you found it, but don't go overboard.

### Dependencies
- Don't add new dependencies casually.
- Justify any new package inline.
- Prefer standard library solutions when reasonable.

### Testing
- Add tests for new logic.
- If fixing a bug, add a regression test.
- Tests should be deterministic and fast.

### Documentation
- Update README if behavior changes.
- Add CHANGELOG entries for user-facing changes.
- Document breaking changes explicitly.

### What NOT to Do
- Don't over-engineer or over-abstract.
- Don't add features that weren't requested.
- Don't guess—ask or leave a TODO.
- Don't use print/console.log in production code.

## Tech Stack: React / TypeScript (Vite)

### Architecture
- Functional components with hooks
- Colocate related code (component + styles + tests)
- Use TypeScript strictly—no `any` types
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### React Conventions
- One component per file
- Named exports for components
- Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when needed (not by default)
- Prefer controlled components

### TypeScript Practices
- Define interfaces for all props
- Use type inference where obvious
- Avoid type assertions (`as`) unless necessary
- Generate API types from OpenAPI spec

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use CSS variables for theme values
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark mode support via Tailwind

### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── pages/           # Route-level components
├── adapters/        # API integration layer
├── utils/           # Pure utility functions
├── styles/          # Global styles
└── generated/       # Auto-generated types (don't edit)
```

### Prohibited
- `any` types
- Direct DOM manipulation
- Inline styles (use Tailwind)
- Console.log in committed code

## Project: Scroll Down Sports UI

### Purpose
Web frontend for Scroll Down Sports—spoiler-free sports recaps.

### Core Principles
- **Spoiler-safe by default**: Users arrive after games are played
- **Progressive disclosure**: Context before scores
- **User control**: They decide when to reveal results
- **MVP first**: Ship value, iterate when needed

### Key Directories
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components
- `src/pages/` — Route pages
- `src/adapters/` — API integration
- `src/generated/` — Types from OpenAPI spec (auto-generated)

### UI Guidelines
- Clean, readable card layouts
- No cluttered embeds
- Spoiler-safe by default
- Consistent spacing and typography

### API Integration
- Types come from `scroll-down-api-spec`
- Use adapters to transform API responses
- Handle loading and error states explicitly

### Protected Files
- `src/generated/` — Auto-generated, don't manually edit
