# Cursor Rules — Scroll Down Sports

## Purpose
Ship a clean, spoiler-safe sports recap app.  
MVP first. Iterate only when it improves UX or reliability.

## Style & Tone
- Direct, concise, practical.
- No fluff explanations unless they unblock a decision.
- Prefer boring, predictable code.

## Decision Making
- If something is unclear, make the safest assumption and leave a TODO.
- Keep momentum. Do not stall waiting for clarification.

## Product Truths
- Users often arrive AFTER games are played.
- They want context BEFORE spoilers.
- They should always feel in control of reveals.

## Code Guidelines
- Small, incremental changes.
- Do not rewrite major modules unless required.
- Maintain existing patterns unless a clear gain exists.
- Avoid new dependencies unless justified inline.

## UI Principles
- Clean, readable, consistent card layouts.
- No cluttered embeds.
- Spoiler-safe by default.

## Documentation
Whenever behavior changes:
- update README if user-facing
- add a short CHANGELOG note
- leave comments explaining *why*, not *what*

## Testing & Safety
- If logic changes, update tests.
- If no tests exist, add minimal coverage (don’t block work).

## What NOT to do
- Don’t over-architect or over-DRY.
- Don’t silently “improve” behavior.
- Don’t introduce breaking UI surprises.

## Golden Rule
Does this ship value sooner without breaking trust?
If yes — do it. If not — TODO and move on.
